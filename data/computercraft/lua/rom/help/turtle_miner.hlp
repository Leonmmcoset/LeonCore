== Description ==
The Turtle Auto Miner is an advanced mining program that allows a turtle to:
- Automatically mine blocks in front of it
- Manage fuel levels and refuel when necessary
- Search for coal ore if no fuel is available in inventory
- Find nearby chests and deposit items when inventory is full

== Features ==
>>color green
- Automatic mining of blocks in front and above
- Intelligent fuel management system
- Automatic coal searching when fuel is low
- Chest detection and item depositing
- Obstacle avoidance
- Status updates during operation
>>color white

== How It Works ==
1. The turtle will start mining blocks in front of it
2. It continuously checks fuel levels
3. When fuel is low, it will:
   - First check inventory for fuel items
   - If none found, search for coal ore by digging downward
4. When inventory is nearly full, it will:
   - Search for nearby chests in all directions
   - Deposit all non-tool and non-fuel items into the chest
5. The program runs until manually stopped with Ctrl+T or encounters critical issues

== Fuel Management ==
- The turtle will refuel when fuel level drops below 500
- It recognizes all fuel items (including coal, charcoal, and other burnable items)
- If no fuel is found in inventory, it will dig downward to search for coal ore

== Inventory Management ==
- The turtle considers its inventory full when there are 15 or fewer empty slots
- When depositing items, it keeps tools and fuel in inventory
- It searches for chests in all four directions, above, and below

== Important Notes ==
>>color red
- Make sure the turtle has appropriate mining tools
- Keep some fuel in the turtle's inventory before starting
- Place a chest nearby to collect mined items
- Monitor the turtle's progress periodically
- Press Ctrl+T to stop the program at any time

== Troubleshooting ==
- If the turtle gets stuck, press Ctrl+T to stop and manually move it
- If it can't find a chest, place one nearby and restart
- If it runs out of fuel, manually add fuel to its inventory
- If mining efficiency is low, ensure the turtle has the right tools
