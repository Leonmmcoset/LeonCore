== Description ==
The Turtle Auto Farmer is an agricultural program that allows a turtle to:
- Automatically detect and harvest mature wheat
- Plant wheat seeds in suitable soil
- Deposit harvested wheat in nearby chests when a full stack is collected
- Monitor fuel levels during operation

== Features ==
>>color green
- Automatic detection of mature wheat
- Seed planting in soil or farmland
- Wheat storage management (deposits at 64 units)
- Fuel level monitoring
- Chest detection in all directions
- Status updates during operation
>>color white

== How It Works ==
1. The turtle will move forward and search for mature wheat
2. When mature wheat is detected, it will be harvested
3. The turtle will collect wheat and seeds
4. Seeds are automatically stored in a designated slot for planting
5. When a full stack of wheat (64) is collected, the turtle will:
   - Search for nearby chests in all directions
   - Deposit the wheat into the chest
6. The turtle will plant seeds on suitable ground as it moves
7. The program runs until manually stopped with Ctrl+T or encounters critical issues

== Fuel Management ==
- The turtle will check fuel levels continuously
- Operation will stop if fuel drops below 200 units
- Ensure the turtle has sufficient fuel before starting

== Inventory Management ==
- Seeds are automatically stored in slot 1
- Wheat is automatically stored in slot 2
- When wheat in slot 2 reaches 64 units, the turtle will search for a chest
- The turtle will deposit wheat in any detected chest

== Important Notes ==
>>color red
- Start the turtle on farmland or near a wheat field
- Ensure the turtle has at least one wheat seed in slot 1 initially
- Place a chest nearby to collect harvested wheat
- Monitor the turtle's progress periodically
- Press Ctrl+T to stop the program at any time

== Troubleshooting ==
- If the turtle gets stuck, press Ctrl+T to stop and manually move it
- If it can't find a chest, place one nearby and restart
- If it runs out of seeds, manually add seeds to slot 1
- If it runs out of fuel, manually add fuel to its inventory
